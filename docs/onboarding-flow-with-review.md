# Updated Onboarding Flow with Dashboard

## Overview

The onboarding flow has been updated to automatically redirect users to a comprehensive dashboard once they have completed their configuration. From the dashboard, users can access all features including the Reddit Post Review.

   - Quick access to all features
   - Navigate to Reddit Post Review
   - Access configuration settings
```

## Implementation Details

### 1. **Onboarding State API**
The `/api/onboarding/state` endpoint now checks for complete configuration:
- Has Reddit OAuth token
- Has at least one subreddit
- Has at least one topic
- Has a prompt configured

When all conditions are met:
- `hasCompleteConfig: true`
- `currentStep: 4`
- `redirectTo: "/dashboard"`

### 2. **Auto-Redirect Logic**
Users are automatically redirected to the dashboard when:
- They complete the configuration step
- They visit the home page while authenticated
- They visit any onboarding page with a complete configuration

### 3. **Configure Page Update**
The "Complete Setup" button now redirects to:
```javascript
window.location.href = `/dashboard`;
```

### 4. **Dashboard Features**
The dashboard now provides:
- Project overview with quick stats
- Direct access to Reddit Post Review
- Configuration management
- Future features placeholders (Analytics, Templates)

## Testing the Flow
