[Keyword] + [Benefit/Result] + [Modifier]
```

### 2. Meta Description Optimization

#### Template:
```
[Action verb] + [keyword] + [unique value prop] + [CTA]
```

#### Character Limits:
- Desktop: 155 characters max
- Mobile: 120 characters ideal

#### Examples by Keyword:

### 3. Content Structure for Maximum SEO Impact

#### Opening Paragraph Formula (100-150 words)

2. **Keyword placement**: Natural inclusion within first 100 words
3. **Promise**: What reader will learn
4. **Credibility**: Why trust this content

#### Header Hierarchy
```markdown
# H1: Include Primary Keyword (only one per page)
## H2: Include Secondary Keywords (2-4 per article)
### H3: Include LSI Keywords (unlimited)
#### H4: Supporting points (as needed)
```

#### Keyword Density Guidelines
- Primary keyword: 1-2% (10-20 times per 1000 words)
